Explanation for live cam:

[1] Enable Live Cam: 
        To use the live camera for a junction, set <<use_live_cam>> to True and provide the correct <<live_cam_index>>.
    Example: For the first junction, the live camera is enabled with <<live_cam_index>> <<0>>.

        If <<use_live_cam>> is <<False>>, the system will use the provided video path.
